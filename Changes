Revision history for Search-OpenSearch

0.01    01 Feb 2010
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    02 Feb 2010
        * initial XML support, via XML::Atom.

0.03    03 Feb 2010
        * drop XML::Atom in favor of hand-rolled XML with Search::Tools::XML.
          This is primarily to avoid double-escaping the highlighting.
        * add snippet and highlighting support via Search::Tools.

0.04    05 Feb 2010
        * fix off-by-one error in fetch_results()

        * add 'engine' to Response
        * add client tests with WWW::OpenSearch

0.07    22 June 2010
        * refactor base classes to move most functionality into the Engine,
          and added 'r' option to not return results (for facets only, e.g.).
        * stringify() Response classes should always return UTF-8 octets (bytes) 
          not characters. This should ensure no "wide character" warnings when
          printing and will work with S::OS::Server::Plack, which requires bytes.
        * add default_boolop support with 'b' param
        * add parsed_query to Response

0.08    xxx
        * add missing 'order' param to default Searcher params

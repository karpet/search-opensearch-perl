Search::OpenSearch::Response - provide search results in OpenSearch format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Search::OpenSearch;
 my $engine = Search::OpenSearch->engine(
    type    => 'Lucy',
    index   => [qw( path/to/index1 path/to/index2 )],
    facets  => {

        sample_size => 10_000,
    },
    fields  => [qw( color size flavor )],
 );
 my $response = $engine->search(
    q           => 'quick brown fox',   # query
    s           => 'score desc',        # sort order
    o           => 0,                   # offset
    p           => 25,                  # page size
    h           => 1,                   # highlight query terms in results
    c           => 0,                   # return count stats only (no results)
    L           => 'field|low|high',    # limit results to inclusive range
    f           => 1,                   # include facets
    r           => 1,                   # include results
    format      => 'XML',               # or JSON
    b           => 'AND',               # or OR
 );
 print $response;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Search::OpenSearch::Response is an abstract base class with some
common methods for all Response subclasses.

=head1 METHODS

This class is a subclass of Moose. Only new or overridden
methods are documented here.

=head2 get_version

Returns the package var $VERSION string by default.

=head2 new( I<params> )

The following standard get/set attribute methods are available:

=over

=item debug

=item results

An interator object behaving like SWISH::Prog::Results.

=item total

=item offset

=item page_size

=item fields

=item facets

=item query

=item parsed_query

As returned by Search::Query.

=item json_query

Same as parsed_query, but the object tree is JSON encoded instead
of stringified.

=item author

=item pps

Pages-per-section. Used by Data::Pageset. Default is "10".

=item title

=item link

=item search_time

=item build_time

=item engine

=item sort_info

=item version

=item suggestions

=item mtime_field

The results field to use for the last-modified logic in get_mtime().
The default is C<mtime>. The field value should be an integer.

=back

=head2 build_pager

Returns Data::Pageset object based on offset() and page_size().

=head2 as_hash

Returns the Response object as a hash ref of key/value pairs.

=head2 get_mtime

Returns an integer representing the most recent mtime of the
current set of results.

=head2 stringify

Returns the Response in the chosen serialization format.

Response objects are overloaded to call stringify().

=head2 add_attribute( I<attribute_name> )

Adds get/set method I<attribute_name> to the class and will include
that attribute in as_hash(). This method is intended to make it easier
to extend the basic structure without needing to subclass.

=head2 default_fields 

Returns array ref of default result field names. These are implemented
by the default Engine class.

=head2 error

Get/set error value for the Response. This value is not included
in the stringify() output, but can be used to set or check for
errors in processing.

=head2 init_author

Builder method for the B<author>.

=head2 init_attr_blacklist

Builder method for B<attr_blacklist>. This hashref of attribute names
registers which attributes are excluded by stringify().

=head2 init_mtime_field

Builder method for B<mtime_field>.

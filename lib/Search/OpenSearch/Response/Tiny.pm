=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Search::OpenSearch;
 my $engine = Search::OpenSearch->engine(
    type    => 'Lucy',
    index   => [qw( path/to/index1 path/to/index2 )],
    facets  => {
        names       => [qw( color size flavor )],
        sample_size => 10_000,
    },
    fields  => [qw( color size flavor )],
 );
 my $response = $engine->search(
    q   => 'quick brown fox',   # query
    s   => 'score desc',        # sort order
    o   => 0,                   # offset
    p   => 25,                  # page size
    h   => 1,                   # highlight query terms in results
    c   => 0,                   # return count stats only (no results)
    L   => 'field|low|high',    # limit results to inclusive range
    f   => 1,                   # include facets
    r   => 1,                   # include results
    t   => 'Tiny',              # or JSON, XML, ExtJS
    x   => [qw( foo bar )],     # return only a subset of fields
 );
 print $response;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

JSON string. The only keys present will be:

 version

Use the Tiny format with the B<x> parameter to the Engine to create
a minimal response size.

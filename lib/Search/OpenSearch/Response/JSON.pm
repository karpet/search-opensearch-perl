    facets  => {
        names       => [qw( color size flavor )],

    },
    fields  => [qw( color size flavor )],
 );
 my $response = $engine->search(
    q           => 'quick brown fox',   # query
    s           => 'rank desc',         # sort order
    o           => 0,                   # offset
    p           => 25,                  # page size
    h           => 1,                   # highlight query terms in results
    c           => 0,                   # return count stats only (no results)
    L           => 'field|low|high',    # limit results to inclusive range
    f           => 1,                   # include facets
    r           => 1,                   # include results

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Search::OpenSearch::Response::JSON serializes to JSON.

The OpenSearch specification is for XML, but some alternative JSON
formats are defined at http://www.opensearch.org/Community/JSON_Formats.

This class follows none of the examples exactly, but is fairly close
to the NYTimes format.

=head1 METHODS

This class is a subclass of Search::OpenSearch::Response. 
Only new or overridden methods are documented here.

=head2 stringify

Returns the Response in JSON format.

Response objects are overloaded to call stringify().

=head2 content_type

Returns appropriate MIME type for the format returned by stringify().
